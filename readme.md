# A learning application (Blog).

There're a lot of choices that are suboptimal and/or just plain incorrect.  Similar to Damn Vulnerable Linux, we want to make a base application full of holes in it, and then patch them up as a learning exercise.

Basic feature list:
- [] user system (CRUD/login/logout).
- [] Posts (CRUD)
- [] like/dislike posts
- [] Comments (CRUD)
